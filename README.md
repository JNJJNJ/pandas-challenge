Homework for Module 4

**Overview**


**Analysis**
- All of the top 5 Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) are charter schools whereas the 5 Bottom-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) are district schools.
- After looking at Scores by School Size almost all Charter schools have Small or Medium sized schools and higher % overall passing whereas all District schools have Large sized schools and low % overall passing.

**Instructions**

***District Summary***

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.
- Include the following:
- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

***School Summary***

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

- School name
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

***Analysis***
- Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.
- Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
- Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
- Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
- Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
- Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
- Use the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary.
